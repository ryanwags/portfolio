## What's in this folder?

This folder contains a sample of modified scripts used to train/test the **Beta-Geometric/Beta-Bernoulli (BG/BB)** customer lifetime value model, created by Peter Fader and Bruce Hardie, and primarily based off their paper [Customer-Base Analysis in a Discrete-Time Noncontractual Setting](http://www.brucehardie.com/papers/020/fader_et_al_mksc_10.pdf). Although the authors provide the raw data used in their paper, they only demonstrate how to replicate their findings in the context of Excel. I developed and later orchestrated a working version of their model in R (this was before my Python days), which would refresh users' lifetime value estimates in real(ish) time as new transactions occurred.
